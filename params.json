B4P is made with Pd-L2Ork distribution of PureData.\r\n\r\n\r\nINSTALL\r\n-------\r\nDownload the project or clone with git:\r\n    \r\n    git clone https://github.com/JoseFuzzNo/b4p\r\n    \r\nAdd the folder to the path in *File > Path...* and restart Pd-L2Ork.\r\n\r\nUSAGE\r\n-----\r\nThe abstractions on B4P are emulations of certain modules. All the basic modules are implemented (VCO, VCF, VCA, ADSR...). The next module is a Voltage Controlled Oscillator. It has four CV inputs, a PWM input and a sync input:\r\n\r\n![[b4p_vco]](https://s9.postimg.org/yn0yda8cv/vco.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nAll modules work with audio signals from -5 to 5 \"volts\". Control signals are usually from 0 to 5 \"volts\". As in modular synthesizers, control signals can be used to make sound and biceversa.\r\n\r\nThe next example shows an LFO controlling a VCO:\r\n\r\n![LFO controlling VCO](https://s13.postimg.org/hgytctvk7/lfo_vco.png)\r\n\r\nAnd of course, a VCO can control another VCO in order to make FM synthesis:\r\n\r\n![FM synthesis](https://s13.postimg.org/ug0e5z2mv/image.png)\r\n\r\nDAISY CHAIN\r\n-----------\r\nSome of the modules have the capability to control other modules of his type. This makes easy to make polyphonic synthesizers.\r\n\r\n![Daisy chaining modules](https://s17.postimg.org/wv32jycj3/daisy_chain.png)\r\n\r\nOnly the modules with the dot input/output have this capability.\r\n\r\nPRESETS\r\n-------\r\nIt is possible to save the state of all B4P object in a patch with the [b4p_preset] object:\r\n\r\n![Presets](https://s17.postimg.org/ozq54vvzj/preset.png)\r\n\r\n**NOTE:* It is necesary to connect this object to a [preset_hub b4p] object.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES\r\n--------\r\nThere are two examples in the *b4p/examples* folder.\r\n- **sequencer**: is a simple example that make use of the [b4p_sequencer] object and adds the output to an LFO. This signal is used to control a monophonic voice.\r\n- **polyphonic_synth**: is an example of a polyphonic synth with four simple voices and a state saving mechanism made with a [b4p_preset] object.",
